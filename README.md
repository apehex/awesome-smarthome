## Dashboards

One of the basic tasks of Home Automation is visualization and control.
Dashboards is a basic way to do that. Dashboard is usually included into
"full stack" HA systems, but what if you don't like it or need a custom
one?

  * https://github.com/Smashing/smashing - maintained fork, 1665 stars
* https://github.com/evolvedlight/pydashie - "Port of Dashing to Python" 416 stars
* https://github.com/allegro/tipboard - Python, 773 stars
* https://github.com/Freeboard/freeboard - JavaScript, 5416 stars
* Grid Layouts
  * https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js - The "default" solution, jQuery plugin (6188 stars)
  * https://github.com/haltu/muuri - No jQuery dep, no item resize (7832 stars)
  * https://github.com/hootsuite/grid (3433 stars)

## Floor Plans

A step above and beyond dashboards is visualizing what happens where on the
actual floorplan of your home.

* [ha-floorplan](https://github.com/pkozul/ha-floorplan) - Floorplans for Home Assistant
* [Sweet Home 3D](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sweethome3d/) - Open Source
  desktop application (Java)
